# NumberSystemsSeminar
Here are the notes to a seminar that I will be giving on Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Number Systems. I will show how each convert to one another (along with Decimal), as well as basic operations.

## Bases
* **Decimal**: Base 10 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9)
* **Binary**: Base 2 (0 and 1)
* **Octal**: Base 8 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7)
* **Hexadecimal**: Base 16 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F)
